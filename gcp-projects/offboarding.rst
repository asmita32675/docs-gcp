Offboarding
===========

While we hope to serve you for life, should you ever decide that you no
longer require Rackspace's management of your GCP project we can work with
you to transition your account to a direct relationship with GCP. You would
retain access to all GCP resources, but would lose access to Rackspace
tooling as well as Rackspace's GCP expertise and service. If you are
considering making this change, please
:ref:`contact your Technical Account Manager <support>` for further assistance.
