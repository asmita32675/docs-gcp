Complex Cloud Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As a business matures or their cloud spend increases, operating GCP can
become more complex. Complex Cloud Operations will help you manage this
complexity with Rackspace experts that have worked with other similarly
complex cloud deployments. Whether you desire a deeper technical
relationship to drive outcomes or need assistance handling your
architecture’s complexity, Complex Cloud Operations can assist.

Rackspace will recommend a tier of support (Bronze, Silver or Gold) based
on customer complexity and requirements. Quarterly, customers will work
with their resources to scope what available capabilities will be
delivered based on level of commitment and customer requirements. Potential
activities include:

* ITIL problem management of recurring incidents
* Architecture diagrams of existing infrastructure
* Creation/Maintenance of basic post-deployment infrastructure configuration
  management scripts

  GCP Trusted Advisor with remediation plan
