Getting Started
===============

It is easy to get started experiencing Rackspace Managed Services for Google
Cloud Platform.

Create your Rackspace account
-----------------------------

The first step is to create your Rackspace account.
Visit https://cart.rackspace.com/gcp and follow the instructions to
establish your account.

Log in with Google
------------------

After you have created your Rackspace account, navigate to the
`Managed Services for Google Cloud Platform Control Panel <https://manage.rackspace.com/gcp>`_.
Once you've logged in, click the "Log in with Google" button to establish a
link between your Rackspace account and Google.

After linking your accounts, you'll be prompted to select the Google
organization that you want Rackspace to manage. Note that a Google
organization can only be associated with a single Rackspace account, and
all projects you wish for us to manage must belong to that organization. You
must have the Organization Admin role in your Google organization to
complete this process, which ensures that only an authorized user completes
this one-time linking. If you require management of projects in more than
one Google organization, consider creating a second Rackspace account or
migrating the projects to a single Google organization.

If you do not already have a Google organization, create one by following
Google's instructions for
`Creating and Managing Organizations <https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-organization>`_.
If you need assistance with this process, please contact your
:ref:`support team <support>`.

Once you've selected your Google organization, you can then select the GCP
project(s) that you would like us to manage. Initially, all projects will be
set to the Runway :ref:`service level <service_levels>`. You can contact
your Technical Account Manager if you want to establish an Aviator service
level GCP project.
