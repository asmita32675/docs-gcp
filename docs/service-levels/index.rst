Service Levels
==============

Rackspace Managed Services for Google Cloud Platform combines tooling and
automation with human experts to deliver a world-class experience. We
offer two service levels, Runway and Aviator, which are selected for
each GCP project we support.

* Runway: "I want access to Rackspace tooling, the ability to request
  on-demand support for a fee, and will manage my GCP project myself."
* Aviator: "I want Rackspace to operate and manage my GCP project for me or
  with me."
